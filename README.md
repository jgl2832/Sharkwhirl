# TODO
- simple http server using 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' running as a daemon for local development purposes
- play music
- can this be a module on another page somehow
- undo github pages nonsense for now, just focus on local dev
- dockerize? maybe a bit much
- TODO figure out how to have background elements that draw on top of other things so they dont look shakey
